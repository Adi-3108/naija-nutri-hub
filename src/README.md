## 🚀 **Getting Started with Azure OpenAI Service**
The GenAI portions of this project leverage Azure OpenAI to get access to `gpt-4o-mini` and other OpenAI models for use. To make it easy for contributors without azure credits, we’re providing Azure subscription codes to get you started.

Follow the guide below to set up your **Azure account, create resources, and retrieve the API keys** you’ll need.

### **📝 Step 1: Activate your Azure Student Subscription**
If you have a student email (e.g., your university-assigned email address), you can sign up for the [Azure Student Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students?msockid=3bc94b5a334e671e3148589032536628). 
This gives you free credits to explore the Azure portal and use services like Custom Vision.

**Disclaimer:** if you don’t have access to azure student subscription or your previous subscription has expired, 
you can request an Azure subscription code from us to get free credits by filling out the [Azure Access Request Form](https://forms.office.com/r/B5fAYrZyB5). 

*Please fill in all required details carefully.* 

### **💳 Step 2: Redeem Your Azure Subscription Code (Optional)**
Once your request is approved, you will receive a **link** and **a verification code**.
1. Navigate to the link provided.

2. Sign up with either your **personal email** or **school email**.

3. During the signup process, you’ll see a field to enter your verification code — paste it here.

4. Complete the signup.

5. You’ll automatically be redirected to the Billing section of your new Azure account.

6. You should now see $100 in free credits available.🎉


### **✅ You’re Ready!**
Once you’ve completed the steps above, you’ll be able to:
 - Get the needed API keys and endpoints of LLMs deployed for use (via Azure AI Foundary or the Azure OpenAI Studio).
 - Integrate with our backend for the generation of Nutritional facts and Recipes of Nigerian foods.
 - Wrap functions around nutrional facts and recipe generations with Datasets/APIs in the [Contribution Guidelines]() and other resources you find relevant to augment/ground responses.



**🙌 Thank you for contributing and making our project better! Happy Hacking!**
